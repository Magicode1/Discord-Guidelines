  "body": "# Discord Server Guidelines\r\n\r\n## Please be respectful at all times on the server(s).\r\n\r\n Any server that we host is a service not only to you, but to others playing as well. We won't hesitate to kick or ban you from any of our game servers if we feel that you are violating other's privacy and sense of self-security.\r\n\r\n##Please don't swear on the server(s).\r\n\r\nWe don't tolerate swearing of any kinds, and any 'Working Around' of our Language blocker will result in a Ban. \r\n\r\n##Please don't invite random people\r\n\r\nThis Chat is designed to be for friends only, and that's fine and dandy, but with more and more people joining, we want to stress the importance of _**NOT INVITING RANDOM PEOPLE!**_ Please also do not include any personal information that you don't want shared out of the chats at all time, just to be safe.\r\n\r\n##Keep the conversations on topic/no spam.\r\n\r\nWe are pretty chill with our server rules relating to off topic chatting, but if you are having a full-blown Destiny conversation in the middle of a Minecraft chat, please just move it before we have to intervene. Thanks.\r\n\r\n#And finally, one last message from a good friend:\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/6bJWc8zyNSBzi\" width=\"480\" height=\"363\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"http://giphy.com/gifs/6bJWc8zyNSBzi\">Noot Noot!</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
